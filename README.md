### What will you find in this repo?

*No money, sorry*

But, you will find our very first coding project, that looks pretty descent!
For our assignment at Becode we had to create a website in HTML/CSS only.
For this, we also invented a product, called CHIP

### Why?

*The coach made us do it*

But also to showcase are developing skills.

### About the product

We also invented a cool AI software program, designed to support people in their personal development. 
Just like a life coach.

#### Product presentation

Hey, meet CHIP!

CHIP is your new soulmate!
He's here to help you through hard times, make you smile and above all, he's here to support you.

We used groundbraking technology and the most effective practices in the Psychology field to create an AI companion
that will act as your own, personal life coach.

CHIP has learned to understand your emotions, help you recover from trauma and he has received a 5 year long training
by the best psychologists in the field.

By interacting with CHIP you will not only receive the right support, but you will also help CHIP become smarter and stronger.
You grow and CHIP grows with you.

What about your privacy?
Well, we're not here to sell your data, we're here to help. Because CHIP is an AI software, he needs data to evolve and improve his coaching skills.
Therefore he will need some data from you, but you have complete control over it.
Every month you'll receive an update on which data has been stored and you'll be able to choose what to keep, what to generalize and what to hide.

A good life coach wins trust and keeps it. CHIP is here for you.
